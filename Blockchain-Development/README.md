# Blockchain Development 
There are two major roles in Blockchain development
1. Blockchain Core developer (10% jobs)
2. Blockchain Software developer (90% jobs)

> Now let's first discuss the role of Blockchain Core Developer and ideal roadmap to follow
### Blockchain Core Developer responsibilities
-  Blockchain building
-  Blockchain working
-  Blockchain mining
-  Blockchain networking
-  Blockchain consensus

### Things to learn
- Programing Language like. C++, Rust, Go (bcz they are good in Blockchain implementation)
- Some core computer science subjects ðŸ‘‡
  - Computer Architecture
  - cryptography
  - Data structures and Algorithm
  - Computer Networks

> Now let's move ahead and discuss most demanding job role- Blockchain Software developer
> NOTE: Here we are going to to discuss the roadmap in the context of ethereum blockchain because of the following reason
>  - Most popular
>  - Most demanding
>  - Developer friendly
>  - Resource and community support
>  - After learning this you can also switch to BlockChains like solana, polygon etc. because fundamentals are going to remain the same

### Blockchain software developer responsibilities
To build: Frontend + Smart Contract => Decentralized Application

### Things to learn
- For Frontend:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - ReactJS(recommended) or AngularJS
 
- For Smart Contract:
  - Solidity Language

- To Connect your Frontend with your Smart Contract, we need to know liberary, You can learn any one of the following ðŸ‘‡
  - Web3.js
  - Ether.js
  - Web3.py

- As blockchain is not scalable and storage of data is very costly currently hence we require knowledge of server and databases to fix these problems
  - For Server you can learn: java / python / NodeJS (recommended)
  - for databases you can learn: MongoDB or MySQL
> NOTE: Learning Smartcontract, liberary and Frontend part should be your priority, rest everything will act like your bonus point to get hired or get any freelance client

- Other tools to know:
  - Truffle
  - HardHat
  - IPFS
  - Geth
  - OpenZepplin(liberary)
  - Chainlink(oracle)

### Emerging fields in Web3
- DeFi(decentralized finance)
- NFTs
- Private Blockchain like Hyperledger fabric etc.
